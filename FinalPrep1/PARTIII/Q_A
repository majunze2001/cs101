List and briefly explain the four foundations of Object-Oriented Programming.
	Abstraction: model anything
	Data encapsulation: single identifier, complex object
	Inheritance: code reuse
	Polymorphism: single object, multiple data structures
	
How many abstract superclasses may a concrete subclass have?
	Only 1, but the superclass it inherits from may have infinite superclasses
	
What three types of methods may an interface contain?
	Abstract, static, default
	
What is the purpose of Method Overriding?
	Achieving its unique implementation of a method of a subclass, different from the implementation in the superclass
	
In the context of an array, explain a map data structure.
	 In an array, the index of an object is an integer;
	 while in a map, the index of an object could be other object.
